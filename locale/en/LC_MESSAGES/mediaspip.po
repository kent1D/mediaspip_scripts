"EXPLICATIONS :\n"
"\n"
"Ce script installera toutes les dépendances logicielles requises pour "
"l'installation de MediaSPIP.\n"
"Il installera ensuite le logiciels SPIP (http://www.spip.net) ainsi que les "
"extensions nécessaires dans le répertoire d'installation spécifié.\n"
"\n"
"PARAMETRES DU SCRIPT\n"
"\n"
"Les paramètres basiques sont :\n"
"\n"
"--help : affiche l'aide du script\n"
"--version : affiche la version du script\n"
"--allways-yes : passer les questions préalables au script\n"
"--log : emplacement du fichier de log de l'installation (/var/log/"
"mediaspip_install.log par défaut)\n"
"--cpus : nombre de core du ou des processeurs que les phases de compilations "
"pourront utiliser (par défaut, on utilise l'ensemble des cores donnés dans "
"le fichier /proc/cpuinfo)\n"
"\n"
"Les paramètres dédiés aux installations de logiciels :\n"
"\n"
"--src_install : répertoire où seront téléchargée les sources des logiciels à "
"installér (/usr/local/src)\n"
"--dep_version : mode d'installation des logiciels. Elle est utilisée pour "
"l'installation de rtmpdump, FFMpeg et FFMpeg2theora, les autres logiciels "
"étant arbitrairement installés de l'une ou l'autre manière. Cette option "
"peut avoir deux valeurs différentes :\n"
"\tdev (valeur par défaut) : installation à jour en récupérant les sources "
"possibles via les logiciels de gestion de version que sont svn et git\n"
"\tstable (ou tout autre valeur) : essaye de n'installer que des releases "
"fixes des logiciels récupérées via une archive figée pour une version\n"
"--disable-ffmpeg : ne pas installer FFMpeg. Plusieurs installations sont "
"affectées par cette configuration car elles dépendent de FFMpeg :\n"
"\tFFMpeg lui-même\n"
"\tFFMpeg2theora\n"
"--disable-apache : éviter de préconfigurer le serveur Apache, l'installation "
"de PHP5 et des classes nécessaires sera quand même réalisée\n"
"--disable-alternc : dans le cas où AlternC est détecté sur votre serveur, "
"cela permet de ne pas prendre en compte cette détection et de ne pas créer "
"les liens symboliques nécessaires au safe_mode\n"
"\n"
"Les paramètres spécifiques à SPIP et MediaSPIP sont :\n"
"\n"
"--disable_mediaspip : ne pas installer ni mettre à jour SPIP et les "
"extensions / plugins / thèmes de MediaSPIP\n"
"--spip : définir le répertoire d'installation final de SPIP et des éléments "
"de MediaSPIP (/var/www/mediaspip)\n"
"--spip-svn : définir le dépot svn que l'on utilise pour le code de SPIP "
"(svn://trac.rezo.net/spip/branches/spip-2.1)\n"
"--spip-user : définir l'utilisateur Unix à qui vont appartenir les fichiers "
"de MediaSPIP (www-data)\n"
"--spip-group : définir le groupe Unix à qui vont appartenir les fichiers de "
"MediaSPIP (www-data)\n"
"--spip-type : définir le type d'installation que l'on souhaite, plusieurs "
"valeurs sont possibles :\n"
"\tferme_full : installe l'ensemble sous la forme d'une ferme (avec le plugin "
"de mutualisation) ainsi que l'ensemble des plugins optionnels et thèmes dits "
"compatibles (choix par défaut)\n"
"\tferme : installe l'ensemble sous la forme d'une ferme (avec le plugin de "
"mutualisation) sans les plugins optionnels ni les thèmes\n"
"\tfull : installe une version standalone avec l'ensemble des plugins "
"optionnels et thèmes dits compatibles\n"
